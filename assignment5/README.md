# Assignment 5: Expanding the JPL Subset

Your fifth assignment is to expand your compiler front end (lexer,
parser, and type checker) to handle a much larger subset of the full
JPL language. In the interests of time, we are not _quite_ asking you
to handle the full language; instead, we are dropping a couple of
features:

- All uses of tuples, including in the type system
- As part of that, `read image` and `write image` will operate on
  monochrome (gray) images
- All of the complex binding forms. Instead, there will be a `dim`
  built-in function for getting the dimension of an array.

The full syntax for this subset is given below.

Your job for this assignment is to extend your parser and type checker
to handle this larger subset of JPL.

Note that we're not asking you to extend flattening and code
generation---there isn't enough time, and ultimately that would mostly
be more of the same code generation that you've already done.

Grammar
-------

The full grammar that you are parsing has four syntax classes: types,
expressions, statements, and commands. All of them have the same
meaning as in the [full language](../spec.md), except that `read
image` and `write image` operate on monochrome images of type
`float[,]` instead of four-channel images of type `float4[,]`.

```
type : int
     | bool
     | float
     | <type> [ , ... ]
```

The type system adds multi-dimensional arrays to the types already
handled by your language. The `pict` type that you implemented in
[Assignment 4](../assignment4/README.md) should be removed; images
should now have type `float[,]`.

Expressions include _most_ of the expressions offered by the full
language:

```
expr : <integer>
     | <float>
     | true
     | false
     | <variable>

     | ( <expr> )
     | <expr> + <expr>
     | <expr> - <expr>
     | <expr> * <expr>
     | <expr> / <expr>
     | <expr> % <expr>
     | - <expr>
     | <expr> < <expr>
     | <expr> > <expr>
     | <expr> == <expr>
     | <expr> != <expr>
     | <expr> <= <expr>
     | <expr> >= <expr>
     | <expr> && <expr>
     | <expr> || <expr>
     | ! <expr>

     | array [ <variable> : <expr> , ... ] <expr>
     | sum [ <variable> : <expr> , ... ] <expr>
     | <expr> [ <expr> , ... ]

     | if <expr> then <expr> else <expr>
     | <variable> ( <expr> , ... )
```

Statements and commands are identical to the subset you've already
implemented, again noting that `read image` and `write image` only
handle monochrome images. However, in this subset we are also adding
function definitions:

```
cmd  : fn <variable> ( <binding> , ... ) : <type> { ;
           <stmt> ; ... ;
       }
    
binding : <variable> : <type>
```

We decided (again in the interest of time) not to add the complex
binding forms, so instead we are adding a builtin, `dim`:

```
expr : dim(<expr>, <expr>)
```

The first argument to `dim` must be an array, of an arbitrary rank.
The second must be an integer. The result is an integer, giving the
length of the array in the given dimension. For example,

    dim(array[i : N] f(i), 0)

must return `N`, because the first argument is a rank-1 array whose
first dimension has length `N`.

The hardest part of this assignment will be correctly parsing this
much larger class of expressions, and in particular handling
precedence for mathematical operators.

It will also be challenging to correctly type-check `array` and `sum`
expressions.

Precedence
----------

Study the precedence rules in the [JPL specification](../spec.md).

These rules explain how some *ambiguous expressions* need to be
parsed. It's easiest to explain this on a smaller and simpler language
than JPL. Consider a simplified language with just numbers, addition,
and multiplication:

```
expr : <integer>
     | <expr> + <expr>
     | <expr> * <expr>
```

As written, `1 + 2 * 3` can be parsed both as `(1 + 2) * 3` or as `1 +
(2 * 3)`. Since we want the second parse tree and not the first, we
need to modify the grammar to rule the second one out.

Consider this expanded grammar:

```
expr1 : <expr1> + <expr1>
      | <expr2>

expr2 : <expr2> * <expr2>
      | <integer>
```

Instead of a single `<expr>` syntax class, there is now an `<expr1>`
and an `<expr2>` syntax class. Moreover, every `<expr2>` is an
`<expr1>` (via the second rule) but the reverse isn't true. For
example, `1 + 2` is a valid `<expr1>`, but it isn't a valid `<expr2>`.
So consider the two possible parse trees of `1 + 2 * 3`:

- In `1 + (2 * 3)`, `2` and `3` are `<expr2>`s via the fourth rule,
  which means that `2 * 3` is a valid `<expr2>` as well, which makes
  it a valid `<expr1>`. And `1` is a valid `<expr2>` which makes it
  also a valid `<expr1>`. So `1 + 2 * 3` is a valid `<expr1>` as well.
  
- In `(1 + 2) * 3`, `1 + 2` is a valid `<expr1>`, but it is not a
  valid `<expr2>`. That means it can't be on the left hand side of a
  multiplication, so this parse tree isn't valid.

You can do the same trick with larger grammars, like the full JPL grammar.

Some other things to watch for. For subtraction, you'll have questions
about associativity:

    1 - 2 - 3 => ((1 - 2) - 3) or (1 - (2 - 3)) ?

This simple grammar allows both:

    expr : <expr> - <expr>
         | <int>

The solution is to realize you want to parse a *sequence* of
subtractions, not one at a time:

    expr : <int> - <int> ...

You can then convert the whole sequence to the right AST.

Another issue is parentheses. When you have parenthesized expressions you want that to 
"override" precedence. So you must build a grammar like this:

    expr1 : expr2 + expr1
          | expr2
    
    expr2 : expr3 * expr2
          | expr3
    
    expr3 : int
          | ( expr1 )

Note that `expr3` has an `expr1` inside parentheses. That "resets" the
precedence. You'd do the same in places like function calls or
anywhere else that precedence is clear.

## CHECKIN Due March 26

Create a short Markdown file `a5-checkin.md` that lives in the root
directory of your repository. Each item below will ask you to include
some text in this file. Please number the sections of this file using
the numbers below. Each of your answers should be enclosed in triple
backticks, like this:

    ```
    your code here
    ```

This makes sure it looks right when viewed on the web.

1. To support the expanded version of JPL, you will need to define a
   number of new AST classes. Do this. Make sure to include all
   relevant member variables (for example, the AST node for the binary
   addition operator should reference two expression subtrees).  You
   will need to make some choices here. For example, do you want a
   single AST node type for all binary operators, or do you want a
   dedicated node type for addition, subtraction, multiplication,
   and so on? Put the code for the classes in `a5-checkin.md`.

2. Produce an _expanded grammar_ for the subset of JPL defined here,
   which enforces precedence. Specifically, this grammar should be
   similar to the grammar given above for `<expr>`, except that
   instead of one `<expr>` syntax class it should have syntax classes
   `<expr1>`, `<expr2>`, `<expr3>`, and so on. An expression where
   precedence is important, such as `1 + 2 * 3`, must have exactly one
   parse tree according to this grammar, and of course it needs to be
   the correct one. Put this expanded grammar in `a5-checkin.md`,
   using the same syntax we've been using for grammars.

3. Write the signature for the type checking function for the
   Assignment 5 version of JPL. Put this in `a5-checkin.md`.

4. Write the type checking function for `array` expressions. Given an
   AST, it should either assign types to all AST nodes in the subtree
   under an `array` node, or else signal a type error (and print a
   reasonable error message). Place the code for this function,
   and any supporting helper methods specific to it, in `a5-checkin.md`/

As always, make sure to push your changes to Github in the main branch
of your repository before the checkin due date.

## HANDIN Due April 2

Implement the parser and typechecker for the version of JPL defined
in this assignment.

Your makefile must support two new command line options. First, if
someone runs `make run-a4p TEST=007.jpl` then your compiler should
parse (but not typecheck or flatten) `007.jpl` and print it out using
the same s-expression format that we used for Assignment 4 (or else
produce a parse error). Check your results against our reference
output by running (from the root directory of your repo) the
`test-a5-parser` script that is in the same directory as this
assignment.

Second, if someone runs `make run-a4t TEST=007.jpl` then your compiler
should parse and typecheck (but not flatten) `007.jpl` and print it
out using the same s-expression format that we used for Assignment 4
(or else produce a parse or typecheck error). Check your results
against our reference output by running (from the root directory of
your repo) the `test-a5-typechecker` script that is in the same
directory as this assignment.
